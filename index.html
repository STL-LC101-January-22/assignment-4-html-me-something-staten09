                  <h2>Destiny</h2>
                  <p>I'll first start off my list with the game that got me serious about gaming. Destiny 1 was released in September 2014. This game, in a way, was revolutionary for those who chose to endure the grind. It was packed with riviting gameplay that pushed cooperation to achieve strenuous goals. This game introduced me to my first gaming clan. We recruited around a total of 45 individuals and became known as TeamPLAY. We've since ventured into different gaming paths, but our then committment to achieve our daily and weekly goals, built a bond that still last to this day.

                  <h2>X-Men Legends 2</h2>
                  <p>Second on my list, is X-men Legends 2. When this game dropped in 2005, my mind raced with excitement! I worked hard to get every penny to be able to purchase this game. For me, it was the best game adaption of my favorite comic book series and cartoon show! Along with the myriad of playable characters, it also included the appearance of my favorite character, Sunfire. I'll never forget the joy this game provided for me!</p>

                  <h2>Need For Speed Underground 2</h2>
                  <p>Where do I begin with Need For Speed Underground 2? Who wouldn't love a street racing game with a dope soundtrack to keep you entranced for hours. It was like I stepping into a Fast and Furious movie. I modeled multiple cars out my close friends personality traits. I got so close to end but one of my friends accidentally corrupted my file. I could never pick up the sticks for this again due to the grind and extensive thought I had put into my creations. </p>

                  <h2>Spiderman (PS5)</h2>
                  <p>"Spiderman. Spiderman. Does whatever a spider can!" Talk about a masterpiece! This game was in development for what seemed like forever, but when it dropped in 2018, it was amazing! (You see what I did there...*wink wink*) The game was visually stunting and so smooth to play. Aside from the great main story, it had numerous fun side quest that I sought out diligently. </p>

                  <h2>Batman Arkham Series</h2>
                  <p>I finised the final installment of this game shortly after completing Spiderman, although it completed it's series in 2015. In my opinion, this game was blueprint for the greatness that became Spiderman. The gameplay was very similar with the edgy darkness of Gotham. It was easy to get into, because just like Spiderman, there were multiple gadgets to use to enhance your combat experience. I am now anxiously awaiting the spin-off, Gotham Knights, which will be releasing this year. </p>

                  <h2>It Takes Two</h2>
                  <p>This was the most surprising experience I've had out of all the games I've ever played. Covid has ruined a lot of things, but while on quarantine, it allowed me to play this game with my wife. It is a strictly 2 player co-op game where you cannot advance without the help of your partner. This game definitely tested out patience but provided laughs, tears, and crazily enough, a deeper appreciation for each other. Which was also coincedently the story of the game. This 2021 'Game of Year' winner, was nothing short of a magnificent creation.</p>

                  <h2>NBA 2k</h2>
                  <p>Each year, 2K just slaps a new paint job on this game and updates the roster. As disappointing as that is, each year, I can't help but buy it. It's the best basketball gaming experience available. My brother's and I are very competetive and are quick to test our skills in it's online rec and against each other. Never has a game pushed us to argue so much. But we still come back to this painful pleasure. </p>

                  <h2>Crash Bandicoot Series</h2>
                  <p>As you can see, there is a common trend with quite of the few games on this list. That very trend is a characteristic of gaming that led me to get my Playstation buttons tattoo that I sport proudly. It is called, connecting with other. The first Crash Bandicoot game came out in 1996. It was then re-released for new systems in 2017. This time around, I was able to connect with two oldest sons.  We spent numerous weekends playing its simple yet infuriating levels. This was the first game they were able to comprehend and play themselves. Their enjoyment of gaming with their father, left me smiling ear to ear.    </p>

                  <h2>Pokemon Series on Gameboy</h2>
                  <p>Last but not least, the game that started it all. I can remember vividly, the nights I'd spend playing my Gameboy Color in front of my nightlight. Oh the sweet nostalgia!</p>
